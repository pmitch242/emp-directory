# Employee Directory 
This repo is an 'Employee Directory' made with React.

## Preview
<img alt="Employee Directory" src="public/assets/images/preview.PNG">    

## Details
When the user loads the page, a table of random employees (cartoon characters) should render. 

The user can:
  * Sort the characters by how funny I personally think they are
  * Filter the characters by their maturity level (again from my prespective)
